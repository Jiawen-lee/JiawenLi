## Four Pillars of Destiny 四柱八字

I am an amateur of ancient Chinese fortune-telling - [Four Pillars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Pillars_of_Destiny) (ba zi). It uses the date and time of your birth to infer your personality, relationship, and destiny based on the reactions and combinations of *Yin-yang* and *Wuxing* ([Five phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxing_(Chinese_philosophy))).

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in such things and I can tell about your future if possible.
