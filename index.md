## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate pursuing a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Data Science Engineering at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). I have the privilege of being advised by Professor [Steve Oney](https://from.so/) at the University of Michigan in web interaction techniques, and I had a wonderful opportunity to spend a summer at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) under the mentorship of Professor [Toby Li](https://toby.li/) in human-agent alignment in web interfaces.

My research interests lie at the intersection of *technical* Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence. With the ultimate goal of achieving **human-AI bi-directional alignment**, I focus on designing and building **interactive human-AI systems** that can be seamlessly integrated into web environments, programming contexts, and the broader spectrum of digital life. I am particularly passionate about creating new interfaces that enhance human capabilities while maintaining meaningful human agency in our increasingly AI-integrated world.
